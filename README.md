Backand is a powerful backend-as-a-service for AngularJS and ReactJS that provides out-of-the-box social login, real-time communication, Ionic integration and much more.

## How to use Backand to create a simple API
* Register account

* See the default database model in Objects -> Model
* Data (for example 'items' in the Default Data Model) can be entered from Objects -> items -> + Add Row
* For examples on how to use the API see Objects -> items -> REST API 

## How to use ready examples to connect to the Backand API
* There are couple examples in this git repository or you can use Backand's examples: https://www.backand.com/app-examples/
* Backand requires a Anonymous Token in order to use the API from a client application withot registering any account
* Anymous Token can be found from Security & Auth -> Configuration -> AnonymousToken 
* This token must be sent with the requests to the API in the request Headers as "anonymousToken"
